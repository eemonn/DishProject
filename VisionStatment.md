# Dish Project Vision Statement 

## Slogan

*"Your recipe book, At your fingertips!"*

## Summary Sentence

The dish project system(DP system) is an application which will allow users to find and dissect their favourite dishes simply by searching the name of the dish. The DP system is focused around letting users find the dish they want to cook and then adding the ingredients they don't have to a shopping list to make the shopping process easier. 

## Description

The system will have a wide range of recipes available for users to look through and find. Once the user finds the dish, it will show a list of all the ingredients that are required along with the quantity that will be needed. Users will have the option to select for how many people they are cooking, and the recipe will dynamically calculate and update the quantity of the ingredients to reflect the changes.  Users will have the option to choose which items or ingredients from the list they want to purchase, and those will be added to a shopping cart. Users can go through many recipes and add the wanted items to the shopping list. The shopping cart will show the items categorized for each recipe to make it easier for users to understand which item is for which dish. 

Users will also have the option to select a dish as a favorite which will appear on the top of the display in order to make it faster for users to find the dish in the future. Users will also have the option to add their own dishes and recipes. Once the user has added their own recipe, they will be able to find that recipe by searching just like all the other recipes that were pre-existing. 

## Target Audience

The audience for this system will be adult people of all range of ages. It will be especially useful for those cooks who like experimenting and creating new ideas. Considering the wider audience, the system will be built to provide the user with a seamless, easy-to-navigate experience. The UI will be designed to make it attractive and accessible for all ranges of users. The system will provide the user with an easy-to-find “Search” feature that will quickly provide the user with the recipe they are looking for without having to go through several steps which will result in reducing cognitive load for the user. 

## Success Criteria

The success criteria for the system will be measured by having users compare our system with an existing system. If the user can find what they are looking for more easily and more quickly compared to the system we are comparing, then we can consider it as a successful system. Hence, the goal of the system is to reduce the number of steps needed to complete a task for a user providing a pleasant experience. Furthermore, efficiency will be compared based on how easily people can add/remove items from the shopping list or modify the shopping list. Overall, the system’s success will be based on the experience that it provides to the user.
