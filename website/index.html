			The dish project system(DP system) is an application which will allow users to find and dissect their
			favourite dishes simply by searching the name of the dish. The DP system is focused around letting users
			find the dish they want
			to cook and then adding the ingredients they don't have to a shopping list to make the shopping process
			easier.

			<br>

			The audience for this system will be adult people of all range of ages. It will be especially useful for
			those cooks who
			like experimenting and creating new ideas. Considering the wider audience, the system will be built to
			provide the user with a seamless,
			easy-to-navigate experience. The UI will be designed to make it attractive and accessible for all ranges of
			users. The system will provide
			the user with an easy-to-find “Search” feature that will quickly provide the user with the recipe they are
			looking for without having to go through
			several steps which will result in reducing cognitive load for the user.

		<p class="text-change" style="text-align: center; color: black">

			The system will have a wide range of recipes available for users to look through and find. Once the user
			finds the dish,
			it will show a list of all the ingredients that are required along with the quantity that will be needed.
			Users will have the
			option to select for how many people they are cooking, and the recipe will dynamically calculate and update
			the quantity of the
			ingredients to reflect the changes. Users will have the option to choose which items or ingredients from the
			list they want to purchase,
			and those will be added to a shopping cart. Users can go through many recipes and add the wanted items to
			the shopping list. 

			Users will also have the option to select a dish as a favorite which will appear on the top of the display
			in order to make it faster for users to
			find the dish in the future. Users will also have the option to add their own dishes to the system. Once the
			user has added their own recipe, they will be able to
			find that recipe by searching just like all the other recipes that were pre-existing.

	<p class ="pleft">
Looking back at the project, we were proud of what we’ve accomplished. As this was the first time most of our team has been part of large project development, it proved to be mostly a positive experience for us. We felt that we achieved everything we initially set out to in our first brainstorming session and vision statement. We ended up implementing every feature we set out to initially in our initial vision of the project. 
</p>
<p class ="pleft">
While we consider our project and its process a success, there are still a few things we would have done differently given the chance. Given the knowledge, we wanted to start using more design patterns earlier in our development. We wanted to make use of the design patterns to clean our code and improve its flexibility, but it proved difficult to refactor our code to use these patterns. As a team, we’d wish we got together during the early days of development and discussed our architecture in more detail. During the 2nd iteration, we had to refactor a lot of classes and where they were located. So given the chance, we would’ve discussed a more detailed architecture, going into detail about specific classes, methods, where we wanted error throwing/handling, etc. Lastly, with a do-over we would’ve assigned a project manager role within our team to handle the bigger picture stuff and lead with a definitive voice. As a team, we had a lot of ideas and found trouble picking the best one so we could’ve used a project manager in situations like those.
</p>
<p class ="pleft">
With it being the first large project development experience for most of our team members, we got the opportunity to learn about what project development really means. One of the most important things we learned about project development was that there needs to be a large amount of coordination to build an app. This meant we had to emphasize meetings and constant communication to ensure that everyone was on the same page, both from a higher level functionality view, to a lower level coding perspective. We also learnt that the workflow of other people is important to consider in a team. Everybody has their own life and may get things done at a very different time/pace than someone else. For example, this needed to be accounted for by giving the person with most initial free time the part that all other parts depend on. From a negative perspective, we learnt that we shouldn’t put off doing dev tasks. The dev tasks were important to figure out how much work a given feature actually was and to make sure one group member did not have too much to do.
</p>
<p class ="pleft">
At the end of iteration 2, we held a retrospective to determine a part of the project that wasn't fully realized. The part in question was the feature of home cards. We felt that the home cards weren’t fully flesh out and didnt feel good from a customer perspective. Our success criteria was seeing if all of the features in iteration 3 relating to the home cards would be completed. Our team managed to finish each and every feature for redoing the home cards and from a subjective perspective, we felt that it was now a better user experience. We therefore considered the retrospective on the home cards a success.
</p>
<p class ="pleft">
Nearing the end of our project development, our team came to several conclusions from everything we’ve worked on. The major conclusion is that agile development was hugely beneficial to us and we took advantage of a lot of the features of agile. We constantly re-thought, re-did, and refactored many parts of our project. Agile also helped us to come back after some of our unsuccessful parts of the project like the home cards. The other major conclusion is how much work developing a full scale app takes. Not only do you have to code all features, but you must also make sure that everything is documented, communicated, and integrated smoothly.
